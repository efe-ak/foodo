            <p>Download and install Vagrant within minutes on Mac OS X, Windows, or a popular distribution of Linux. No complicated setup process, just a simple to use OS-standard installer. The only requirement besides Vagrant is VirtualBox, and it is just as simple to install.</p>

            <p>Sit and watch as in just a few moments you'll have a fully running virtual machine in VirtualBox running Ubuntu Server 14.04 LTS with the latest front-end development tools pre-installed. You can SSH into this machine with <code>vagrant ssh</code>, and when you're done playing around, you can remove all traces of it with <code>vagrant destroy</code>.</p>
            <p><strong>Now imagine every complex project you've ever worked on being this easy to set up.</strong></p>
            <p class="margin-none">With Vagrant, <code>vagrant up</code> is all you need to work on any project, to install every dependency that project needs, and to set up any networking and synced folders so you can continue working from the comfort of your own machine.</p>
